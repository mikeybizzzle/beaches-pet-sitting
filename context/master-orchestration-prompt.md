Start with: "Initializing Beaches Pet Sitting website development. Setting up Next.js project with TypeScript and required dependencies..."

Then proceed to build the complete website autonomously, only stopping if you encounter environment-specific issues that require external input (like API keys or deployment credentials).

Remember: The goal is a professional, high-converting website that builds trust through veterinary credentials and makes booking incredibly simple. Use the Fetch Pet Care design as inspiration while creating a unique identity for Beaches Pet Sitting.
